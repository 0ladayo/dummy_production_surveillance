# production_surveillance_project

In this project, I built a production surveillance dashboard from scratch to production to monitor changes in wells parameters using data from the oilfield daily reports.

The dashboard is event driven, scales with additional data from subsequent daily report and delivers key insights.

**Note: because of data privacy, I replaced the actual wells data with randomly generated numbers
